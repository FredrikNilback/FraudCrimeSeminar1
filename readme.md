# Plotting Swedish fraud crime statistics with python
In my criminology course we're tasked with discussing different crime categories during our seminars.
My group was given the category: Fraud. 

Knowing the statistics is a vital part of being able to discuss these topics. 
As such I decided to use the available data from Brå (Brottsförebyggande rådet) to make these graphs.
